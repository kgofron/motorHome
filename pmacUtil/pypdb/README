== Introduction ==
This directory contains two types of files:
* scripts to automate the creation and application of translation templates
* translation templates

The purpose of these translations is to convert from one naming convention to
another. The templates currently convert from the DLS naming convention to the
NSLS-II naming convention.

== Prerequisites ==
=== PYPDB ===
The "pypdb" applications written by Michael Davidsaver must be installed and
accessible  on the path. The two applications that are required are:
* getpvs
* applypvs

=== EPICS ===
The DBD files for each record type need to be available on the machine creating
the translation templates. They are not required for applying the PVs to an
existing database or EDM file.

== Usage ==
The scripts show the command line details for creating and applying templates.
After creating a template, it must be manually edited to give the correct
translations for each PV name.
